# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This Python tool evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria: length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to help users improve their password strength.

## How It Works

The tool checks a password against the following criteria:
- **Length**: The password should be at least 8 characters long.
- **Uppercase Letters**: The password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
- **Lowercase Letters**: The password should contain at least one lowercase letter.
- **Numbers**: The password should include at least one digit.
- **Special Characters**: The password should contain at least one special character (e.g., `!`, `@`, `#`, etc.).

Based on these criteria, the tool assigns a strength rating to the password:
- **Very Strong**: Meets all criteria.
- **Strong**: Meets 4 out of 5 criteria.
- **Moderate**: Meets 3 out of 5 criteria.
- **Weak**: Meets 2 out of 5 criteria.
- **Very Weak**: Meets 1 or fewer criteria.

If the password does not meet all criteria, the tool also provides feedback on how to improve it.

 Enter a password when prompted. The tool will assess its strength and provide feedback.

## Example

```bash
$ python password_strength.py
Enter a password to assess: P@ssw0rd123
Password Strength: Very Strong
```

If the password does not meet all criteria, the tool will suggest improvements:

```bash
$ python password_strength.py
Enter a password to assess: pass123
Password Strength: Weak
Feedback:
- Password should be at least 8 characters long.
- Password should contain at least one uppercase letter.
- Password should contain at least one special character.
```
